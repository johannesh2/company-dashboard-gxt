# Company Dashboard sample

This is a small dashboard sample app. The sample UI code is mostly copied from the GPL versio of Sencha's own GXT Explorer app.
There is a simple JPA backend with H2 database. The UI is accessing the backend over RPC service. This sample is a reference
point for comparing how the same application could be implemented using Vaadin Framework. The Vaadin sample can be found at

To run this sample, execute the following Maven goals:
`mvn package jetty:run`
